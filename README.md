## HomePod

This is an html/css/js stack designed for a 5in Waveshare display screen. I've designed it to link with n8n webhooks and my previous JARVIS assistant from another repository. 
This is meant to replace a siri or alexa with a smart agent linked to your environment. The homepod has 8 apps: Clock (dark for sleep or having on overnight), light controls, weather, stocks, travel map, sports scoreboard for the 4 major US sports, spotify player, and a voice note recorder / playback. The middle button is designed to trigger any llm or ai you have a valid api key to use.

## Setup

The setup is simply replacing sensitive values with your own, search for "!ADD!", and add the necessary values. These will be api keys, webhooks, location, stocks, and travel destinations. 
I recommend git cloning via a computer, editing in your necessary values, and then scp via ssh on the waveshare display. The waveshare is meant to use Pi OS.
